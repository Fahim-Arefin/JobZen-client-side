          Understanding Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Access tokens and refresh tokens are essential concepts in
          authentication and authorization mechanisms, commonly used in web
          applications.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-md">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-800 mb-2">
              What is an Access Token?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
              An access token is a credential used to gain access to specific
              resources on a server. It is commonly used for user authentication
              and authorization in web applications. Access tokens are usually
              short-lived and expire after a set period.
            </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-md">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-800 mb-2">
              What is a Refresh Token?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
              A refresh token is a longer-lived token that is used to request a
              new access token after the original access token expires. It helps
              maintain the users session without the need for them to re-enter
              their credentials. Refresh tokens are securely stored and are not
              meant to be exposed to the client-side.
            </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-md">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-800 mb-2">
              How Do They Work?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
              Access tokens are obtained by the client after successful
              authentication with a server. These tokens are sent with each API
              request to authenticate the client. When the access token expires,
              the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token
              from the server, avoiding the need for the user to log in again.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-md">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-800 mb-2">
              Where Should We Store Them on the Client-Side?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
              Access tokens should be stored in a secure manner on the
              client-side. Commonly used options for storage include HTTP
              cookies, local storage, or session storage. However, its crucial
              to consider security implications when choosing a storage
              mechanism. Its best to use HttpOnly cookies for access tokens and
              store them in an HttpOnly cookie for added security.

              The website is designed to provide a visually captivating
              experience, with a primary focus on creating a visually pleasing
              design with unique elements. This emphasis on visual appeal
              ensures that users are engaged and find the website not only
              functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The color contrast has
              been carefully considered to be easy on the eye, creating a
              pleasing and comfortable browsing experience. Proper alignment and
              spacing have been implemented throughout the website, ensuring
              that all elements are well-organized and that the design is free
              from any distracting or jarring visual elements. Customization of
              design components has also been undertaken where necessary. For
              example, if a component is sourced from a library like Daisy UI,
              efforts have been made to customize the styling of the component
              to ensure it seamlessly integrates with the overall design. This
              focus on a unique and appealing design is essential in creating a
              positive user experience, making the website stand out, and adding
              value to the portfolio. The website also places a strong emphasis
              on user authentication. A seamless registration and login process
              has been implemented, and the system is designed to provide
              relevant error messages when needed. This ensures that users can
              easily create accounts and log in to the website while having a
              clear understanding of the steps involved. One of the core
              features of the website is the job listings. The homepage includes
              a banner section with a search input field, allowing users to
              search for job listings that match their preferences. The jobs are
              categorized into various types, including On-Site Jobs, Remote
              Jobs, Hybrid Jobs, and Part-Time Jobs. The website implements a
              tab system for these job categories, making it easy for users to
              explore the type of job listings they are interested in. This
              categorization and tab system provide a user-friendly approach to
              job searching and enable users to quickly find the jobs that align
              with their requirements. The website also includes an educational
              content section in the form of a blog. This section provides

              access tokens, insights into Express.js, and information about
              Nest.js. The educational content enhances users knowledge and can
              be particularly valuable for individuals looking to explore web
              development and related technologies. Another critical aspect of
              the website is job management. Users can view job listings, apply
              for jobs, add their own job listings, and manage the jobs theyve
              posted. This feature is particularly useful for both job seekers
              and employers, as it streamlines the process of job application
              and management. To facilitate ease of use, the website
              incorporates a search system. Users can search for specific jobs
              by title or category, making it efficient to find job listings
              that match their interests and skills. The search system enhances
              the user experience and helps users find relevant job
              opportunities more quickly. In the event of navigating to
              non-existent pages, the website has a custom 404 error page. This

              experience. Security is a paramount concern, and the website
              addresses this through the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
              for authentication on protected routes. This robust security
              mechanism ensures that user interactions and data are safeguarded,
              instilling trust and confidence in users. Additionally, the
              website dynamically changes its page title based on the route,
              providing users with context and enhancing their experience. This
